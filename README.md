# Strategy

“Just Face It” is a SPA that enables the sharing, filtering, and sorting of skincare routines from users around the world. The app is designed to be user friendly with minimal guesswork and have filtering options for user to acquire the most relevant skincare routine for their skin type.

## Site Owner Goals

Our skin is the largest organ on our body. Stereotypes and stigma have prevented many from seeking to improve their skin’s health and succumbed to living with a treatable condition. “Just Face It” aspires to provide a platform for user to share, comment, and search through different skincare routines posted by real users, and allows communication within the community by enabling commentary on any routines that have been posted to facilitate cross education.

- Pleasing and gentle colour tones
- Allow users to post their own personal skin care routine
- Routines are featured front and centre of the site
- Easily filter out routines based on user’s skin type
- Allow users to access a library of products that users have posted based on product category
- Easy to navigate
- Provide links to products that might be monetized in future

## User Stories

As a user, I sometimes find it difficult to browse through an entire catalogue of skincare products from major retailers like Sephora or YesStyle and determine which product might be for me. Moreover, the phenomenon of “paid reviews” in the industry is rampant and I do not wish to be misdirected.

I desire a holistic place where I can view and learn from real users who are interested in taking care of their skin’s health with real, effective products that has benefitted them. It is crucial for the site to be easy to navigate and anonymous.

I also would like to be able to filter and sort through the different product types based on their efficacy on different skin types, and have fellow users comment on my current routine that I posted online to educate myself.
